# LVM
LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager, and it is a software-based storage management solution used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. LVM allows for more flexible and dynamic management of disk space compared to traditional partitioning schemes.

# Type of Volume
  # Physical Volumes (PV)
   - Physical volumes are the underlying storage devices, such as hard drives or partitions, that are combined to create volume groups.
  # Volume Groups (VG)
   - Volume groups are created by combining one or more physical volumes. Logical volumes are then created within volume groups.
  # Logical Volumes (LV)
   - Logical volumes are similar to partitions but have more flexibility. They are created within volume groups and can be dynamically resized without the need to repartition the disk.
  # Extents
   - LVM divides physical volumes and logical volumes into units called extents. Extents are used to allocate and manage storage space.
  # Striping and Mirroring
   - LVM supports advanced features like striping (dividing data across multiple physical volumes for performance) and mirroring (creating redundant copies of data for fault tolerance).
  # Snapshotting
   - LVM allows the creation of snapshots, which are point-in-time copies of a logical volume. This feature is useful for backups and testing.
  # Dynamic Resizing
   - One of the significant advantages of LVM is the ability to resize logical volumes on-the-fly without disrupting data access.

# LVM
LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager, and it is a software-based storage management solution used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. LVM allows for more flexible and dynamic management of disk space compared to traditional partitioning schemes.

# Type of Volume
  # Physical Volumes (PV)
   - Physical volumes are the underlying storage devices, such as hard drives or partitions, that are combined to create volume groups.
  # Volume Groups (VG)
   - Volume groups are created by combining one or more physical volumes. Logical volumes are then created within volume groups.
  # Logical Volumes (LV)
   - Logical volumes are similar to partitions but have more flexibility. They are created within volume groups and can be dynamically resized without the need to repartition the disk.
  # Extents
   - LVM divides physical volumes and logical volumes into units called extents. Extents are used to allocate and manage storage space.
  # Striping and Mirroring
   - LVM supports advanced features like striping (dividing data across multiple physical volumes for performance) and mirroring (creating redundant copies of data for fault tolerance).
  # Snapshotting
   - LVM allows the creation of snapshots, which are point-in-time copies of a logical volume. This feature is useful for backups and testing.
  # Dynamic Resizing
   - One of the significant advantages of LVM is the ability to resize logical volumes on-the-fly without disrupting data access.

  1. Installing LVM tools
  - Before using LVM, ensure that the LVM tools are installed. You can install them using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu systems:
      ```
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install lvm2
      ```
  2. Creating Physical Volumes (PV)
  - Use the `pvcreate` command to initialize a disk or partition as a physical volume.
     ```
     sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX   
     ```
     - Replace /dev/sdX with the appropriate disk or partition

  3. Creating Volume Groups (VG)
  - After creating physical volumes, group them together to form a volume group using `vgcreate`.
     ```
     sudo vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdX2   
     ```
     - Replace vg_name and /dev/sdX* with your desired names and physical volumes

  4. Creating Logical Volumes (LV)
  - With a volume group in place, you can create logical volumes. Specify the size and name for each logical volume.
     ```
     sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_name vg_name   
     ```
     - Create a 10GB logical volume named lv_name in volume group vg_name

  5. Formatting and Mounting Logical Volumes
  - Format the logical volume with a file system of your choice and mount it
     ```
     sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name
     ````
     - Format with ext4, replace with your desired file system
     ```
     sudo mount /dev/vg_name/lv_name /mnt   
     ```
     - Mount the logical volume

  6. Displaying LVM Information
  - Use commands like `pvdisplay`, `vgdisplay`, and `lvdisplay` to show information about physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes
     ```
     sudo pvdisplay
     sudo vgdisplay
     sudo lvdisplay
     ```

  7. Resizing Logical Volumes
  - You can resize logical volumes as needed
     ```
     sudo lvresize -L +5G /dev/vg_name/lv_name   
     ```
     - Increase the size by 5GB

  8. Snapshot Creation
  - Create a snapshot of a logical volume for backup or testing purposes
     ```
     sudo lvcreate --size 2G --snapshot --name snap_name /dev/vg_name/lv_name   
     ```
     - Create a snapshot

  - These are basic examples, and there are many more features and options available with LVM.
